    <abstract>
      <t>
        This document standardizes an HTTP extension header field that
        allows third-party HTTP-clients to include the user agent
        string of the HTTP-client that is bundled with the device
        operating system.
      </t>
    </abstract>

  </front>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        An optional header, User-Agent was originally defined by
        Hypertext Transfer Protocol RFC 1945 (since superseded by
        <xref target="RFC2616" />). Its intent was to enable
        statistical tracking, allow tracing of protocol violations,
        and provide a means for tailoring responses based on HTTP user
        agent limitations, quirks and capabilities.
      </t>

      <!-- <t>
        Application developers have long used the user agent string to infer user agent capability. Increasingly, developers are relying on the user agent string to infer the capabilities of the hardware, firmware, and operating system on which the user agent runs. In some cases, the user agent string is also used to infer what other software may be running in addition to the user agent.
      </t>

  <t>
        This works as follows: When the HTTP client includes a
        User-Agent header, the value of the header is compared to a
        datastore of stock or native user agent strings and known
        capabilities of the device on which it is known to run.
        Responses are then tailored based on the results supplied by
        this datastore.
      </t> -->

      <t>
	Such content negotiation assumes a one-to-one relationship
	between the value of the User-Agent header and a device.
	However, many HTTP clients do not have such a relationship --
	third-party web browsers that run on top of device operating
	system software, for example.
      </t>

      <t>
	To compensate for this, some third-party clients include an
	additional, non-standardized header. The value of this header is set to the
	user agent string of the device's native client. In practice,
	several different non-standard headers are in use, and do not all
	comply with <xref target="RFC6648" />
      </t>

      <t>
	Applications can use such headers, when available, to serve
	content optimized for a particular device. This document
	standardizes the syntax and semantics for the Device-Stock-UA
	header for this purpose.
      </t>

    <section title="Notational Conventions">
      <t>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
        "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
        in <xref target="RFC2119" />.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Syntax Notations">
      <t>
        This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
        notation of <xref target="RFC5234" /> with the list rule
        extension defined in Section 3.2.5 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging" />.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Device-Stock-UA"  anchor="int_device_stock_ua">
      <t>
        The Device-Stock-UA HTTP header is an OPTIONAL header field
        that, when used, discloses the user agent of the native
        browser for a device or operating system. This is for
        statistical purposes, as well as to tailor responses to
        particular user agent or device constraints.
      </t>

      <t>
        When the Device-Stock-UA header is included with a request,
        other non-standard headers that report a user agent string may
        be included.
      </t>

      <t>
        Third-party browsers that use the same user agent string as
        the device's default browser SHOULD NOT include the
        Device-Stock-UA header, i.e. its presence indicates the use of
        something other than the default browser user-agent string.
      </t>

      <t>
        If the user agent string for the default browser changes, as
        with an operating system update, the Device-Stock-UA header
        SHOULD mirror this change.
      </t>

      <t>
        The parameter names are case-insensitive.

        The header field can be defined in augmented BNF syntax as:

        <figure> <!-- BNF START -->
          <artwork>
        Device-Stock-UA = "Device-Stock-UA" ":" 1*(user agent string)
          </artwork> <!-- BNF END -->
      </figure></t>

      <t>
        Example:
        <figure><artwork>
    Device-Stock-UA: CERN-LineMode/2.15 libwww/2.17b3
        </artwork></figure>
      </t>
  </section>

    <section title="Use of Device-Stock-UA Header">
      <t>
        Entities that provide web analytics services SHOULD use the
        Device-Stock-UA header (if present) in addition to the
        User-Agent header in their identification of devices to ensure
        that devices are correctly measured.
      </t>

      <t>
        Content publishers MAY wish to use the Device-Stock-UA header
        (if present) rather than the User-Agent header in order to
        determine the nature and capabilities of the underlying device
        rather than, or in addition to, the capabilities of the
        browser in question.
      </t>

      <t>
        Publishers of third-party HTTP-capable clients SHOULD include
        the Device-Stock-UA with each HTTP request in order to enable
        publishers to recognise the underlying device.
      </t>

<!--      <section title="Future extensions">
        <t>
          One may extend this RFC by writing new RFCs that define new parameters.
          IANA should be notified if an RFC is updating this RFC with
          new valid parameters.
        </t>
