    <abstract>
      <t>
        This document standardizes an HTTP extension header field that
        allows third-party HTTP clients and embeddable HTTP client components to include the user agent
        string of the HTTP-client that is bundled with the device
        operating system.
      </t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        An optional header field, User-Agent was originally defined by
        Hypertext Transfer Protocol RFC 1945 (since superseded by
        <xref target="RFC2616" />). Its intent was to enable
        statistical tracking, allow tracing of protocol violations,
        and provide a means for tailoring responses based on HTTP user
        agent limitations, quirks and capabilities.
      </t>

      <t>
        Application developers have long used the user agent string to infer user agent capability. Increasingly, developers are relying on the user agent string to infer the capabilities of the hardware, firmware, and operating system on which the user agent runs. For example, the user agent string is sometimes used to infer the display size, or whether the user agent allows access to the device file system.         In some cases, the user agent string is used to infer what other software may be running in addition to the user agent, such as a bundled media player or mapping service.
      </t>

     <t>
        This works as follows: When the HTTP client includes a
        User-Agent header field, the value of the header field is compared to a
        datastore of stock or native user agent strings and known
        capabilities of the device on which it is known to run.
        Responses are then tailored based on the results supplied by
        this datastore.
      </t>

      <t>
	Such content negotiation assumes a one-to-one relationship
	between the value of the User-Agent header field and a device.
	However, many HTTP clients do not have such a relationship --
	third-party web browsers that run on top of device operating
	system software, for example.
      </t>

      <t>
	To compensate for this, some third-party clients include an
	additional, non-standardized header field. The value of this header field is set to the
	user agent string of the device's native client. In practice,
	several different non-standard header fields are in use, for example: X-OperaMini-Phone-UA, used by Opera Software ASA; X-Device-User-Agent; and X-ATT-DeviceId, used by AT&amp;T Inc.
	  </t>

      <t>
	Applications can use such header fields, when available, to serve
	content optimized for a particular device, such as a mobile phone, electronic reader, or tablet computer. This document standardizes the syntax and semantics for the Device-Stock-UA
	header field for this purpose.
      </t>

    <section title="Notational Conventions">
      <t>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
        "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
        in <xref target="RFC2119" />.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Syntax Notations">
      <t>
        This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
        notation of <xref target="RFC5234" />.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Device-Stock-UA"  anchor="int_device_stock_ua">
      <t>
        The Device-Stock-UA HTTP header field is an OPTIONAL header field
        that, when used, discloses the user agent of the native
        browser for a device or operating system. This is for
        statistical purposes, as well as to tailor responses to
        particular user agent or device constraints.
      </t>

      <t>
        When the Device-Stock-UA header field is included with a request,
        other non-standard header fields that report a user agent string may
        be included.
      </t>

      <t>
        Third-party browsers that use the same user agent string as
        the device's default browser SHOULD NOT include the
        Device-Stock-UA header field, i.e. its presence indicates the use of
        something other than the default browser user-agent string.
      </t>

      <t>
        If the user agent string for the default browser changes, as
        with an operating system update, the Device-Stock-UA header field
        SHOULD mirror this change.
      </t>

      <t>
        The parameter names are case-insensitive.

        The header field can be defined in augmented BNF syntax as:

        <figure> <!-- BNF START -->
          <preamble></preamble>
          <artwork>
        Device-Stock-UA = "Device-Stock-UA" ":" 1*(user-agent-string)
          </artwork> <!-- BNF END -->
          <postamble></postamble>
      </figure></t>

      <t>
        Example:
        <figure>
         <preamble></preamble>
         <artwork>
    Device-Stock-UA: CERN-LineMode/2.15 libwww/2.17b3
        </artwork>
        <postamble></postamble>
        </figure>
      </t>

      <t>
      The user-agent-string should be retrieved from the firmware, matching that of the HTTP client bundled with the firmware.
      </t>
  </section>

    <section title="Use of Device-Stock-UA Header Field">
      <t>
        Entities that provide web analytics services SHOULD use the
        Device-Stock-UA header field (if present) in addition to the
        User-Agent header field in their identification of devices to ensure
        that devices are correctly measured.
      </t>

      <t>
        Content publishers may use the Device-Stock-UA header field
        (if present) rather than the User-Agent header field in order to
        infer the nature and capabilities of the underlying device
        rather than, or in addition to, the capabilities of the
        browser in question.
      </t>

      <t>
        Publishers of third-party HTTP-capable clients SHOULD include
        the Device-Stock-UA with each HTTP request in order to enable
        publishers to recognise the underlying device.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
        <t>Because the Device-Stock-UA header field includes hardware and operating system/firmware information, it may help an attacker narrow the scope of an attack by first targeting the client device.</t>

        <t>The value of Device-Stock-UA may not correctly represent the hardware and software. It can easily be spoofed on the client or modified between the endpoints.</t>

        <t>This header field may reveal more information about the hardware or firmware of the device that can be used for tracking purposes.</t>
