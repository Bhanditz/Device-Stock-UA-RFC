                      draft-brown-device-stock-ua

Abstract

   This document standardizes an HTTP extension header field that allows

   the device operating system.

Internet-Draft       Device-Stock-UA HTTP Extension       September 2012


1.  Introduction

   An optional header, User-Agent was originally defined by Hypertext
   Transfer Protocol RFC 1945 (since superseded by [RFC2616]).  Its
   intent was to enable statistical tracking, allow tracing of protocol
   violations, and provide a means for tailoring responses based on HTTP
   user agent limitations, quirks and capabilities.

   Application developers have long used the user agent string to infer
   user agent capability.  Increasingly, developers are relying on the
   user agent string to infer the capabilities of the hardware,
   firmware, and operating system on which the user agent runs.  In some
   cases, the user agent string is also used to infer what other
   software may be running in addition to the user agent.

   This works as follows: When the HTTP client includes a User-Agent
   header, the value of the header is compared to a datastore of stock
   or native user agent strings and known capabilities of the device on
   which it is known to run.  Responses are then tailored based on the
   results supplied by this datastore.

   Such content negotiation assumes a one-to-one relationship between
   the value of the User-Agent header and a device.  However, many HTTP
   clients do not have such a relationship -- third-party web browsers
   that run on top of device operating system software, for example.

   To compensate for this, some third-party clients include an
   additional, non-standardized header.  The value of this header is set
   to the user agent string of the device's native client.  In practice,
   several different non-standard headers are in use, and do not all
   comply with [RFC6648]

   Applications can use such headers, when available, to serve content
   optimized for a particular device.  This document standardizes the
   syntax and semantics for the Device-Stock-UA header for this purpose.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Syntax Notations

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation of [RFC5234] with the list rule extension defined in Section

Internet-Draft       Device-Stock-UA HTTP Extension       September 2012


   3.2.5 of [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging].


4.  Device-Stock-UA

   The Device-Stock-UA HTTP header is an OPTIONAL header field that,
   when used, discloses the user agent of the native browser for a
   device or operating system.  This is for statistical purposes, as
   well as to tailor responses to particular user agent or device
   constraints.

   When the Device-Stock-UA header is included with a request, other
   non-standard headers that report a user agent string may be included.

   Third-party browsers that use the same user agent string as the
   device's default browser SHOULD NOT include the Device-Stock-UA
   header, i.e. its presence indicates the use of something other than
   the default browser user-agent string.

   If the user agent string for the default browser changes, as with an
   operating system update, the Device-Stock-UA header SHOULD mirror
   this change.

   The parameter names are case-insensitive.  The header field can be
   defined in augmented BNF syntax as:

           Device-Stock-UA = "Device-Stock-UA" ":" 1*(user agent string)

   Example:

       Device-Stock-UA: CERN-LineMode/2.15 libwww/2.17b3


5.  Use of Device-Stock-UA Header

   Entities that provide web analytics services SHOULD use the Device-
   Stock-UA header (if present) in addition to the User-Agent header in
   their identification of devices to ensure that devices are correctly
   measured.

   Content publishers MAY wish to use the Device-Stock-UA header (if
   present) rather than the User-Agent header in order to determine the
   nature and capabilities of the underlying device rather than, or in
   addition to, the capabilities of the browser in question.

   Publishers of third-party HTTP-capable clients SHOULD include the
   Device-Stock-UA with each HTTP request in order to enable publishers
   to recognise the underlying device.

6.  Security considerations

   Blah blah


7.  IANA considerations

   This document specifies the HTTP header listed below, which should be
   added to the permanent HTTP header registry defined in [RFC3864].
